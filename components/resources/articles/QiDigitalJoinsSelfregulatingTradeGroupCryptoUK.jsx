          London, UK – Qi Digital is delighted to announce that it has joined
          Crypto UK, the self-regulatory trade association for the UK crypto
          asset industry, launched in 2018 and established to promote higher
          standards of conduct.

          undertake financial transactions, to the benefit of consumers,
          business and security. They achieve this by working together to help
          educate politicians and regulators about the crypto asset industry to
