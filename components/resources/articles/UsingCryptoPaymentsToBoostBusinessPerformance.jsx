        <p className="header">More and more people are buying with crypto.</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s true! Recent studies show that nearly two-thirds of all people
          holding cryptocurrencies are interested in investing their money in
          products and services. That’s a potentially ripe market for small and
          large merchants alike to tap into.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The assumption that crypto payments are niche is ebbing away. With
          statistics such as these suggesting that people are growing more
          receptive to using crypto for everyday transactions, it’s clear that
          business owners can be more confident in setting up payment facilities
          in-store or online.
        </p>
        <p className="header">
          Businesses are at risk of getting swept behind the tide.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Customers are getting more interested in crypto payments, so
          enterprises and firms are also warming up more to the idea of
          broadening their banking options. While there are always risks and
          considerations to keep in mind, one thing is for certain – it’s now or
          never.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Despite the relative age of coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, we’re
          still on the precipice of the cryptocurrency revolution. This means
          there’s never been a better time to start embracing ‘alternative’
          payment methods and tap into growing markets.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The danger for companies who don’t adopt or even consider crypto
          payments right now is that they’ll risk falling behind the pack. As we
          all know, technology advances at a blistering pace.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Therefore, within a few years, businesses that don’t accept crypto
          now, may find they’re too late to get ahead of the curve.
        </p>
        <p className="header">Easing customers in is key.</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          One of the biggest concerns merchants have when eyeing a shift to
          crypto payments is whether or not customers will know what to do with
          their money. What’s more, will moving to crypto mean giving up on fiat
          (or traditional) payments altogether?
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Not at all. In fact, by embedding crypto payments technology into
          existing platforms, it’s easy to help guide customers to options that
          appeal most to them. Removing traditional card or e-wallet payment
          avenues is a risky manoeuvre and not one we recommend outright (unless
          your business or industry allows for it) – meaning you can continue
          trading as normal while adapting to crypto payments for the future.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          This means you have very little (if anything) to lose. You can still
          conduct the same payments and transactions as always, while ensuring
          you have the technology in place to embrace the crypto transaction
          revolution as and when it arises.
        </p>
        <p className="header">There are numerous benefits for businesses.</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Businesses that adopt crypto payments, immediately break down
          international barriers for overseas customers. Whereas some
          administrative red tape restricts traditional or fiat payments
          depending on the territory, cryptocurrencies are designed as global
          money – meaning you can effectively open up your operation worldwide
          (if you haven’t already).
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          What’s more, consider the speed of crypto transactions. While card and
          e-wallet transactions may seem instantaneous, they’re still subject to
          numerous checks and measures in line with fraud prevention. Crypto
          contracts are steadfast and designed as fraud-proof – meaning
          transactions take place almost instantly.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          There’s also a public ledger available that details all crypto
          transactions taking place around the world. This ultimately means
          there’s no doubt as to who’s invested in which services, removing all
          doubt and concern.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Beyond this, business owners only need to set up a digital wallet and
          a code to start accepting crypto. There’s no need for banks, costly
          credit accounts, or overdrafts. You have complete control over your
          money, and your customers will thank you for the ease of use.
        </p>
        <p className="header">Other points to consider.</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          When looking into crypto payments for your business, do also consider
          the financial benefits. Firstly, accepting crypto payments means you
          effectively avoid cross-currency conversion rates. This means your
          buyers based abroad receive products and services based at a flat rate
          you set.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          There’s also the fact that crypto transactions are markedly cheaper
          than traditional transfers. While banks and card issuers demand
          increasingly high rates just for businesses to accept plastic
          payments, the best crypto merchant portals offer cost-effective rates
          with all of the listed benefits above on top.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Do also think carefully about your history with chargebacks. Merchants
          facing chargebacks from customers often fall prey to extra expenses –
          and fiat payment options are wide open to fraud, regardless of card
          protection services.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          With crypto payments, transactions are ironclad and clear to view on
          the public ledger. There’s no room for doubt and certainly no space
          for anyone to attempt fraud. That alone will cut down hassle and
          expense for most merchants and enterprises.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Ultimately, accepting crypto payments doesn’t just open you up to more
          business and make life easier on customers. It also helps to make
          things cheaper and more cost-effective for all parties in the
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p className="header">Ready to start accepting crypto?</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          We’re far from at a point where cryptocurrencies are mainstream
          business assets. However, getting ahead of the pack now means you’ll
          have a clear advantage over other firms still making up their minds in
          years to come.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Crypto isn’t going away – if anything, it’s growing more popular with
          businesses and buyers alike. Now’s the time to partner with a gateway
          who can help you adopt crypto payments alongside traditional
          transactions.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Consider the cost savings, the business potential, and the added
          protection you gain against fraud and money laundering. You don’t even
          need to commit to crypto outright until you’re ready. However, make
          the decision to adopt crypto into your enterprise payment system
          sooner rather than later to help your business to gain an advantage
          over your competitors.
