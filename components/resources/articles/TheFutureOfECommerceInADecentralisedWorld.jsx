        <p className="paragraph">
          Thanks to the introduction of blockchain technology, leading to the
          possibilities surrounding a metaverse, the potential for decentralised
          eCommerce is growing rapidly. As we will find out in this article, the
          future of eCommerce in a decentralised world is a very promising one.

          Decentralised Servers Running Through the Metaverse Minimise Fraud
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Companies are beginning to realise how security can be maintained at a
          higher level than is currently the norm – decentralised servers that
          run through a metaverse can minimise fraud, and how payments are
          processed can and will open up new levels of security.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Sellers and consumers will probably feel that the processes in place
          are more secure than the traditional methods, and therefore more
          likely to invest in businesses, or purchase from businesses.
          E-commerce in particular has been troubled by not having the highest
          level of security and privacy, whilst not compromising transparency
          and convenience for the customer. Blockchain technology should help
          with this, and so should the metaverse.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Most eCommerce platforms store information that they collect from
          their suppliers and customers using centralised servers. The downside
          to this method is that companies are prone to cyber attacks, and huge
          companies such as Amazon and Ebay are proof of this. If these
          companies and others were to store their data using blockchain and
          within the metaverse, a much better level of security would be
          offered.

        <p className="header">The Phore Decentralised Marketplace</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The ‘Phore Decentralised Marketplace’ is a game-changer. It allows
          entrepreneurs and sellers an opportunity to swerve the complicated,
          risky, and time-consuming choice of which format to sell their goods
          or services on. Instead, it allows businesses to sell goods across the
          world without having to maintain their website. The great thing about
          this is the cost it saves, which is often involved in most platforms
          you can use, something that can hurt the bottom line of a business.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Essentially, if you are selling on the Phore Market, you have an
          unlimited selling space that isn’t restricted by borders. Sellers just
          have to make sure they abide by all of their local regulations. If a
          sale is made on this marketplace it will be paid for using the Phore
          digital currency. Peer-to-peer exchange functionality is developed for
          the next iteration of the platform which allows both merchants and
          consumers to swap tokens as and when they want to.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Another plus is that merchants can offer their products at better
          prices, as the Phore Marketplace doesn’t charge high fees – the fees
          are low to zero, thus helping sellers to improve their profit margin.
          This can help small businesses fight back against the big competition
          like Amazon and Ebay by being able to reduce their fees.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The Phore team makes a strong effort to provide privacy and economic
          freedom, as data is not collected, stored, or sold in any shape or
          form. In fact, the team is trying to increase the rights and
          protections for those using it even further. Phore is just one out of
          many more to come, and is an interesting early innovation that offers
          some exciting possibilities for the future of eCommerce.

        <p className="header">Fulfilment</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Now, shipping speed is very important for eCommerce. Diversifying
          fulfilment capabilities can provide many benefits, and a decentralised
          eCommerce experience can help with this factor. Standards can increase
          for supply chain and data management through emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Due to the disruptions across the eCommerce spectrum, businesses and
          consumers have needed to take on a new level of flexibility. More than
          ever we have been witnessing inconsistencies with shipping carriers,
          more out-of-stock items, price fluctuations, and increased demand for
          warehouse space. This has caused a lot of volatility in the sector,
          something which hurts consumers and businesses alike.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          {" "}
          It might be safe to say some of these issues are easing, however, we
          can never know for sure. And even if they are, surely lessons need to
          be learned for the future so we can be better prepared. We have
          learned that flexibility needs to be ripe in every aspect of a
          successful eCommerce business, and one of the areas where this is
          especially integral is fulfilment.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          If the future of eCommerce is a more decentralised one, fulfilment
          could be improved significantly. It would be far more cost-effective
          and flexible, making it easier for a customer to have the options they
          need, and for an eCommerce business, the resources to quickly and
          easily meet said need.

        <p className="header">
          More Trust in Payment Transactions and Less Third Parties
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The big financial institutions play a large part in the average
          eCommerce transaction, and in many respects this has been fine, but
          there have been times where it has caused issues. For instance, if one
          of these big companies goes down for some time, or they make a call
          that unfairly leaves either the consumer or business out of pocket.
          Having to rely on a third party for a transaction to be complete
          therefore has its downsides. It makes things slower, more expensive,
          and often, consumers may not trust them to make fair decisions.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          One of the reasons for the added costs with centralised transactions
          is because when a third party needs to get involved to solve an issue,
          this raises the cost factor, and goes back to the customer and/or
          business. These extra costs make small, casual transactions difficult
          and this can affect individuals, businesses, and other organisations
          such as charities wanting to take donations.
        </p>
        <p className="header">Summary</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The future of eCommerce within a decentralised world like the
          metaverse makes a lot of sense in principle, and appears to be a
          natural progression from what we currently have now and what the
          future could hold. We can learn from history that, sometimes, the key
          to a smooth transaction is to involve as few different
          formats/individuals/companies as possible, making things quick and
          simple for the supplier and customer. This can also help keep costs
          down for both, something that is very important now, as the world
          seems to be facing a rising costs crisis that doesn’t appear to be
          going away any time soon. This direction could help restore customers
          who may have had to spend less online, and could help businesses who
          have been struggling to survive.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The path to reach this direction probably won’t be plain sailing, but
          gradually we will see improvements on how we currently do things and
          allow for more options than ever before within the eCommerce sector.
          Many have been put off by third-party companies that get in their way
          when they are trying to have a smooth experience that isn’t too
          expensive (this goes for both consumers and businesses). A metaverse
          can help fix this issue, making things more immersive, and with fewer
          unwanted add-ons such as transaction fees and long waiting times. It
          seems like everyone could be a winner.
