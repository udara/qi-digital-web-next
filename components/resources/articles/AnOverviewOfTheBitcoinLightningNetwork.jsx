      "An overview of what the Bitcoin Lightning Network is and how it can be used in the real word.",
    body: (
      <>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Proposed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in 2015, the ‘Lightning
          Network’ was designed in order to speed up Bitcoin transactions whilst
          keeping the costs as low as possible. As a concept, it belongs within
          a newer group of crypto technologies known as “layer 2” blockchains –
          transactions take place outside of the blockchain, thus becoming
          ‘off-chain’.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Having to approve of and store Bitcoin transactions can become
          extremely costly and time-consuming if their numbers on the network
          multiply. This means that the processing power of computers needs to
          be improved, so Lightning Network is essentially a network of
          decentralised nodes that allows for a large number of transactions. It
          facilitates micro-payments in order to improve the Bitcoin
          blockchain’s ability to conduct and process transactions more
          efficiently.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          So, the idea of the Lightning Network is that, by off-loading some
          Bitcoin traffic to layer 2, the core Bitcoin blockchain can move at a
          faster pace. By doing this, it allows for a dramatic increase in both
          transaction speed and throughput, improving Bitcoin’s scalability
          issue and making it a viable method of payment.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The Lightning Network helps Bitcoin to function more like Satoshi
          Nakamoto’s original intention of being a “peer-to-peer electronic
          cash” option, as he put it back in 2009. It removes the need for
          central institutions such as banks but does not implement a new token.
          It does, however, allow for the same freedoms as Bitcoin, meaning it’s
          decentralised, permission-less, and completely open source.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Since Lightning Network is connected to the existing Bitcoin
          blockchain, it benefits from all of Bitcoin’s security protocols,
          making it that much more reliable. This connection is extremely
          valuable because it means that users are able to choose the main
          blockchain for bigger transactions and then switch to the Lightning
          Network’s off-chain for smaller transactions without having to worry
          about their privacy and safety.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Typically, the main blockchain (layer 1) can handle less than 10
          transactions per second, but in comparison, the Lightning Network
          (layer 2) can handle, in theory, millions of transactions per second.
          If its aim is to become a viable means of payment it must compete with
          other existing methods, one of which being Visa. Visa currently
          processes around 4,000 TPS but can also handle up to highs of around
          65,000. Lightning Network can potentially handle billions of TPS.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The settlement time for Lightning Network transactions is under a
          minute and can even occur in milliseconds. Confirmation time on the
          Bitcoin blockchain, in comparison, occurs every ten minutes. There is
          also no actual limit to the amount of payments (per second) that can
          occur when using Lightning, the amount of transactions is only limited
          by the capacity and speed of each node.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          El Salvador runs the government-created wallet ‘Chivo’, which is
          Lightning Network compatible and can enable seamless cross-border
          payments, and Twitter users can send and receive Bitcoin tips via the
          Lightning Network. These are just two active examples, and you can
          expect many more companies to utilise the Lightning Network over the
          coming months.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          In September 2020, there were just under 13,900 Lightning nodes and
          over 37,000 channels in operation – the total network capacity of the
          Lightning Network at this time was at 1,098 BTC, roughly $11.4
          million. In 2021, the total network capacity had grown by 40.7% in the
          span of roughly a year.
        </p>
        <p className="header">So, who could use the Lightning Network?</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          In the wake of decentralised technologies, technically anyone could
          start using, or at least interacting with the Lightning Network.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          However, as a protocol it will be used by payment processors,
          especially ‘back-end’ payments and banking service providers. The
          benefits to such organisations utilising this method include but are
          not limited to; increased and improved efficiency, faster and near
          zero processing fees, for example you can transfer £10 via Lightning
          and the cost is so low (0.000000001p) that is not recognised in the
          current ‘conventional’ financial models. Therefore, resulting in the
          recipient receiving the whole £10.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Other benefits also include instant scalability as the inefficiencies
          and high costs attached to cross-border payments will be a thing of
          the past.
