          If you’ve spent any time looking into the future of the internet
          (especially regarding cryptocurrencies and blockchain), you’ve likely
          come across the term ‘Web3’.

          However, there are quite a few steps for us to take before Web3

        <p className="header">Web2.5 – a quick overview</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Web2.5 is a term that’s used to describe a few different facets about
          our current digital society. At its simplest, the phrase refers to our
          current position, slightly beyond the social media basics of
          yesteryear, while looking ahead to the full adoption of
          cryptocurrencies and augmented or virtual spaces.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Web2.5 also refers to businesses and services based online that
          operate on a digital economy. That is, services which stand away from
          transactions we’d expect from the internet of 2006, and which revolve
          entirely around being online and trading in a digital space.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          However, these companies operate on a basis that mainstream internet
          users are familiar with. As we’re not all yet trading on blockchain
          nor fully invested in the metaverse, there are multiple web-based
          services that slot in well with the Web3 ideal, but work based on Web2
          standards.
        </p>
        <p className="header">Some examples of Web2.5 brands</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          A really simple example of a hypothetical Web2.5 brand is Fiverr.
          Fiverr is a highly popular gig economy site that’s been around for
          several years but will likely transition easily into Web3.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="blank">
            Fiverr
          </a>{" "}
          offers a digital economy based on a variety of services. It’s a
          marketplace through which people can offer services and skills in
          return for money. This, as it stands, is currency paid into private
          wallets, that can then be withdrawn in fiat currency if required.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Services available on Fiverr that can transition into a fully digital
          economy include content writing, graphic design, and video
          testimonials. Crucially, this is a marketplace that will assimilate
          easily into Web3 while having been born during Web2.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Another example is Patreon, a pay-to-unlock service where creators
          generate content and services for membership tiered fees, similar to
          Kickstarter, for private audiences. Content platforms such as
          OnlyFans, too, cater to niche demographics (in this case, largely
          those seeking adult entertainment).
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Spotify is another digital economy player that filters down a
          veritable weeks’ worth of music and podcasts into one monthly
          subscription. If it’s a service you can subscribe to and receive
          digital content from, it’s Web3 ready, and it’s a big player in the
          digital economy.
        </p>
        <p className="header">What are the benefits of Web2.5?</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Web2.5 is a fantastic transitionary bridge that will help people
          understand how transactions on Web3 are likely to take place. It’s
          considered something of a ‘training ground’ for the wider population,
          preparing them for the next big digital revolution.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          At present, blockchain technology proves to be highly complex for many
          people who want to invest long-term. Web2.5 companies such as Patreon
          present a system that will work well in Web3, but in a way that’s easy
          to digest and convenient to follow with modern technology and
          expectations.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Users can simply pay for subscriptions they’d like to set up, and
          receive digital content based on parameters set by the creators they
          pay. This system enables an instant supply-and-demand setup that
          satisfies all parties involved, and while we are using current
          technology to facilitate this, a similar setup will work just as
          smoothly on Web3.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The differences may be, of course, that users are immersed in the
          content itself while paying for it. They might make an instant payment
          using BTC or ETH, and immediately gain access to exclusive new
          material.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Digital content creators, such as those developing NFTs, will
          eventually be able to produce augmented variations of their art for
          users to interact with. This may either be through AR projection, or
          via VR headset as part of the metaverse.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Ultimately, Web2.5 serves to provide the populace with a brief ‘taste’
          of what’s to come, albeit in a familiar format and setup that they can
          easily acclimatise to.
        </p>
        <p className="header">What happens next?</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The next stage is, of course, full Web3. However, getting there isn’t
          going to be a straightforward task. For example, metaverse technology
          is still very much in its infancy, and currently at a niche adoption
          rate.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          However, companies such as Meta and Apple are showing interest in what
          happens next. Therefore, it is likely that our most familiar brands
          will lead the way as to when and how such a revolution takes place.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Beyond this, it will take some time before government bodies and
          centralised banks adapt to the blockchain. Blockchain and
          cryptocurrencies are still very ‘new’ to mainstream audiences, and
          with mass media focusing on volatility as points to be scared of, we
          do have a way to go before the ‘mainstream population’ is prepared for
          Web3.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          But, that doesn’t mean it will never happen. Web3 is inevitable. It’s
          another stage along in our intrinsic need for greater data autonomy,
          and our increasing thirst for convenience and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Just as Web2 took millions of us by surprise, Web3 is likely to
          transform the way we work and entertain ourselves in a short matter of
          years. It will simply take a big brand or two to make some intriguing
          new hardware, and for a few more businesses to adopt crypto, and we
          will be well on the way to Web3.
