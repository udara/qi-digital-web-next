      "While adopting a crypto strategy may still seem like a bold, possibly even a risky move for some business owners, there are a few strong reasons why it could be a fantastic power play even for the smallest of merchants.",

        <p className="paragraph">
          Although cryptocurrencies remain unknown entities for many big
          businesses and centralised bodies worldwide, adoption isn’t letting
          up. Despite media spin on the volatility of cryptocurrencies feeding
          into negative perceptions, coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have
          proved they always bounce back.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          What’s more, incredible strides to improve the security and
          scalability of coins such as Ethereum are becoming more and more
          commonplace. While adopting a crypto strategy may still seem like a
          bold, possibly even a risky move for some business owners, there are a
          few strong reasons why it could be a fantastic power play even for the
          smallest of merchants.
        </p>
        <p className="header">It’s real-time money</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          A major drawback of centralised fiat currencies is the processing
          time. Traditional currencies arrive with extensive checks and measures
          thanks to their centralised setups. While it may seem as though
          transactions take place instantly due to real time authorisation, for
          the actual movement of the money, this is hardly the case.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Businesses reliant on fiat money are at risk of bank rejections and
          extensive waiting periods to clear international red tape. It’s all in
          the name of security, of course – and despite all that pro-fiat
          commentators may say about safety, money laundering is still an
          enormous problem for physical money handlers.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Crypto, on the other hand, trades instantaneously. Blockchain
          transactions record absolutely, meaning that there’s no doubt over
          authenticity or whether or not a payment can be fully processed. For
          larger merchants, real-time money transfers equal more business, on a
          secure basis, in shorter periods of time.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Businesses adopting crypto can therefore get ahead of the competition
          by processing more sales, more often. This is a huge power play – and
          one that hesitant merchants may need to pay attention to sooner rather
          than later.
        </p>
        <p className="header">
          It opens up businesses to entirely new demographics
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s entirely possible that, simply through unlocking crypto payments,
          a business can appeal to completely new audiences. Consumers who
          actively avoid fiat transactions, for example, may turn to a new
          adopter if they are one of the few in their industry to accept crypto.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Given that crypto adoption is yet to be ‘fully mainstream’, now is a
          great opportunity for business owners to look carefully at the
          competition. How many other industrial rivals openly accept crypto as
          well as fiat payments?
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          If it’s very few, moving into crypto can be a fantastic power play
          over the competition, as it will open up new doors that merchants may
          not have previously considered. By balancing crypto processing
          alongside traditional fiat channels, there’s also no risk of losing
          traditional customers.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          In fact, there’s also an opportunity here to encourage traditional
          fiat spenders to move into crypto, too. Many business owners see
          crypto reliance as too risky in the current climate – but it’s no
          longer a niche interest. What’s more, you can offset doubt by
          retaining fiat transfers until you’re more confident to go fully
          digital.
        </p>
        <p className="header">It opens up the world to your business</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          In an ecommerce-heavy society, people buy and sell across borders all
          over the world. As such, there’s more and more demand for businesses
          to open up services and products to cater to overseas markets.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          However, reasons tied to currency transfers and the costs incurred may
          prevent smaller businesses and merchants from taking such a leap. On
          top of fiat trading taking considerable time to process due to checks
          and measures along the way, there’s the matter of whether or not it’s
          financially viable to accept international orders.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Crypto can, however, help to reduce both the hassle and exorbitant
          costs of currency exchange. Bitcoin, for example, was developed as a
          single global currency. Ethereum, too, is available to invest in
          worldwide, and neither are subject to the fees and checks associated
          with traditional money.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Adopting crypto to open up international business is not only
          worthwhile from a cost-saving perspective, but also from a growth
          perspective. Merchants and companies that embrace crypto open doors to
          developing nations and economies that would otherwise find it
          impossible to trade with traditional currencies.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It’s a power play simply because when you start accepting crypto, you
          start accepting trade from just about anywhere. That’s a huge
          competitive edge in many industries, and it’s one that not many
          merchants or business owners are taking full advantage of.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          If the internet helped to break down communication barriers the world
          over, then crypto is doing the same for trade on a similar scale.
        </p>
        <p className="header">It’s future-proofing</p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Adopting crypto as a merchant for payment of goods and services is a
          power play in that it shows you’re unafraid to embrace the future.
          Physical paper trails are slowly dying away, and this fate will also
          befall physical money and transactions.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          While crypto is still seen as ‘niche’ by some people, digital
          currencies are still growing in popularity. By the end of the decade,
          cryptocurrencies are likely to be more ubiquitous than ever, whether
          or not all governments and banks are comfortable with their presence.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Ultimately, adopting crypto now – as a business – is a confident step
          in the right direction. It’s a step that – while risks are involved –
          shows potential customers that you’re willing to embrace new
          technology, and that you care about accessibility, convenience, and
          security. All three principles are virtuous in the app-driven age.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          Future-proofing any business is difficult, as no one really knows
          what’s going to happen in the years to come. However, crypto’s
          resilience and continued evolution suggests that the best time to
          start accepting and processing coins for business purposes was – of
          course – yesterday.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph">
          There are always going to be risks when adopting new financial
          standards for business purposes. However, there are still abundant
          risks with handling fiat money. Could your merchant business afford to
          fall prey to some of the big power plays crypto-friendly rivals might
          soon adopt?
